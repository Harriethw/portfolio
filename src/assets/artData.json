Explore, prod and poke this colourful little vignette until you are ready to throw back the duvet and begin your day.",
    "extraDescription": "Made in Unity for the Oculus Go, this is my second solo VR piece. I learnt a great deal about 3D modelling and crafting an experience without relying (too much) on words to tell a story."
